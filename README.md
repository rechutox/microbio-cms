# Microbio CMS
It's a super simple flat-file CMS

## Features
 - Flat-file based. No database needed bitches!
 - Routing based on file name as slug
 - Create/edit/delete pages from the front-end
 - Basic autentication based on an ACL in config file
 - CSRF safe (I think...)
 - Easily themeable
 - All config in one YAML file
 - Fast, not sure how fast but it's really fast
 - Extendable, thanks to it's simplicity
 - It's a one-day experiment, so the source code is messy and no good as an example
